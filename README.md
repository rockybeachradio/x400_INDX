Welcome, to my software pack for the Eryone Thinker x400 with Bondtech INDX

# Information about this project
This is an Firmware for the Eryone Thinker x400 with Bondtech INDX \
    https://github.com/rockybeachradio/x400_INDX \
 \
 This uses a RaspberryPi 5 instead using the MKS SKIPR SoC. \
 \
It is based on https://github.com/rockybeachradio/x400-software-pack \


# Known bugs
- [ ] at24c_eeprom: Error during Klipper start.


# Backlog:

## To check Eryone Stuff:
- [ ] at24c_eeprom by Eryone
- [ ] farm3d by Eryone
- [ ] Scripts by Eryone
- [ ] KlipperScreen panels by Eryone

## ToDo
- [ ] Remove "duplicate_pin_override" in chamber_temp_mgmt.cfg --> Software solution, or another temperature sensor


## Check why eryone has spezial versions and is not using the original ones. (commands found in relink_conf.sh)
- [ ] cp /home/mks/KlipperScreen/moonraker/moonraker/components/machine.py /home/mks/moonraker/moonraker/components/       - Check what is different in the Eryone version
- [ ] cp /home/mks/KlipperScreen/config/timelapse.cfg  /home/mks/moonraker-timelapse/klipper_macro/                        - Check what is different in the Eryone version
~~- [ ] cp  /home/mks/KlipperScreen/klipper/ /home/mks/  -rf~~
- [ ] How is KlipperScreen calling eryone scripts? Where are the scripts used?
    - ln -s /home/mks/KlipperScreen/all /home/mks/mainsail/all

## Check why these files are in the eryone repo compared to the original repos.
- [ ] Eryone Scripts /all/ --> Where are they used?
- [ ] Eryone /KlipperScreen/ --> Check
    - /KlipperScreen/Panels/ - What are they doing?
        - [ ] calibrate.py
        - [ ] change_name.py
        - [ ] chgfilament.py
    - [ ] /KlipperScreen/ks_includes/zh_TW/KlipperScreen2mo  - Check what is different in the Eryone version
    - [ ] /KlipperScreen/screen.py  - Check what is different in the Eryone version
- Eryone /klipper/ --> Check
    - /klipper/klippy/extras/
        - [ ] as5600.py
        - [x] at24c_eeprom.py
        - [x] gcode_shell_command.py
        - [ ] pressure_sensor.py
    - [ ] /klipper/lib/rp2040/
    - [ ] /klipper/lib/rp2040_flash/
    - [ ] /klipper/src/rp2040/rp2040_link,lds.S --> ??? new: rpxxxx.lds.s
    - [ ] /klipper/src/pressure_sensor.c --> deleated on 20250825 (by eryone)
- [ ] Eryone /moonraker/mooonrkaer/components/timelpase.py redirect to /moonrkaer-timelapse/components/timelpase.py --> Why?
- [x] Eryone /moonraker-timelapse/ --> What was changed by eryone?
    - MKS path hardwired & sudo makerspace added
    - timelapse.py: MKS path hardwired 

## Eryone farm3d
- /scripts/install_software.sh
    - [ ] "pip3 install" commands used. Code is from /eryone-scripts-all/install_lib.sh. Not working on Debuan systems. See next install.sh topic.
- install.sh
    - [ ] "pip3 install" command used. \
        Debian/Ubuntu-like system that implements PEP 668. Which marks the system Python as “externally managed,” so "pip3 install" to the system site-packages is blocked to avoid breaking OS packages.
    - [x] --> changed strings in farm3d.service that the replacement works
    - [x] --> Added farm3d.service installation
- [x] update.sh: Executes git fetch. but there is no /.git/config. Calls mq.py --> only works when orioginaly cloned from github.com/eryone/farm3d repo. --> use x400-software-pack/scripts/update.sh instead
- run.sh
    - Calls: ./mq.py
    - Calls: /eryone-scripts-all/monitor.sh which is doing nothing
    - [x] Uses hardcoded paths (/home/mks/") and "~"    --> changed to $HOME
    - [x] Uses "echo makerbase | sudo -S service crowsnest restart"  --> removed "echo makerbase" part
 - mq.py - is the MQTT Handler which takes care of the communication between klipper and farm3d server
    - Loads: ./klipper_config.cfg
 - klipper_config.cfg   --> Loaded in mq.py
 - farm3d.service   --> calls run.sh
 - get-pip.py - Standard python installer for pip   --> Not used
